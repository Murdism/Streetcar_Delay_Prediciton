# Streetcar_Delay_Prediciton

## Background
###System:
The Toronto streetcar system is a network of ten streetcar routes in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, operated by the Toronto Transit Commission(TTC).
As many transportation systems, this streetcar system has the occasional delays in its routes.
###Goal:
The goal of this project is to predict and possibly avoid the delay in the streetcar system.
###Data:
The data that is going to be used in this project has been collected by the TTC since 2014.
